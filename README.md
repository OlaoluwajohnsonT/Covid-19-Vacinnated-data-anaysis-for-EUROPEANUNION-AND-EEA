Performing EDA Analysis for European and EEA Covid-19 Vaccinated Data

# INTRODUCTION
The dataset under analysis provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 vaccination efforts within the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) region. As of September 2023, this dataset contains a wealth of information that encompasses crucial facets of the vaccination campaign. It is collected through The European Surveillance System (TESSy) and serves as a fundamental tool for tracking the progress and outcomes of vaccination initiatives.

Contained within this dataset are essential data points, including the number of vaccine doses distributed by manufacturers, details on the administration of first, second, additional, and unspecified doses, and valuable demographic information on target age groups. Moreover, the dataset delves into the realm of vaccine types, revealing which vaccines are most widely used and which have seen the highest administration rates.

One of the dataset's critical features is its temporal dimension, allowing us to observe trends and variations over time. This longitudinal perspective is invaluable for understanding how vaccination efforts have evolved, particularly in response to changing epidemiological circumstances and public health strategies.

In essence, this dataset serves as a treasure trove of insights into the ongoing battle against the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEA. Analyzing this data can unearth trends, patterns, and critical indicators that can guide vaccination strategies, and public health policies, and ultimately, contribute to the global effort to combat the virus. In the following analysis, we will embark on a journey through this data, aiming to distill meaningful insights that can inform and improve vaccination efforts in the region.
